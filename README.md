### CityList

What is the goal of the project?  
- The goal of this project is to create a web app that maintains a 'bucket list' of things that a user selects to do in a particular city and ties each activity to a responsive map  
- Stretch goals include:  
  - Incorporating Google Places API autofill functionality  
  - Figure out a way to calculate 'top trending' list items for the 'Top Trending' section  
  - Make it workable for cities other than Seattle  

Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?  
- My target audience is myself and Seattleites who want a convenient way to keep track of things to do/see in Seattle  

What are your personal learning goals?  
- Get experience working with interactive maps  
- Get more practice working with TDD  

What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?  
- I will use a Rails backend to manage data storage and any API calls  
- I will use a Javascript frontend to handle the data rendering and site interactivity  
- I will try using TDD when working in Ruby/Rails.  

What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?  
- I will need to get an access key from either Google Maps or MapBox to access their interactive map data.  
- This project will require knowledge of Ruby & Rails and Javascript. It will also involve completely new geographic datatypes, which I am looking forward to getting exposure to.  

What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?  
- Success looks like a webpage on which a user can create an account, login, and create/manipulate a 'bucket list' of things to do in Seattle.  
  - They will be able to CRUD things to their list  
  - They will be able to see their list items on an interactive map
